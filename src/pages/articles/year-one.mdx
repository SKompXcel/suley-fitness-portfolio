# One Year In: Nothing will ever be the same

It’s been a year since I made that first promise to myself. I remember the feeling, the weight of that decision to train every single day, no matter what. And now, after 365 days of relentless work, I’m still here, still standing, still pushing harder than ever. What I’ve realized over these last few weeks, though, is that the limits I thought I had? They were mostly in my head.

For the first year, it was tough—brutally tough. I followed my seven-day split: push, pull, legs, shoulders/traps/forearms, and repeated. No breaks. No rest. I trained every day till I physically couldn’t lift anymore. The fatigue was real, my body was sore, and for a while, it felt like I was just barely hanging on. But I kept going. And now, after two months of grinding it out, something clicked.
