# Time to Roll with the Punches

Last week, on October 16th, life threw me a real curveball. I was stopped in traffic when a car slammed into me at 70-80 km/h. The impact was brutal. Airbags went off, and I ended up in the hospital with neck and back pain, and a concussion. I’ve been doing daily recovery work—stretching, sauna, and exercises—but it’s tough. Not being able to train like I used to has taken a toll, physically and mentally.

The hardest part was missing one of my kids' karate classes. Hearing that my student, David, was upset I couldn’t make it really hit home. It made me realize how much my students look up to me. That moment reminded me of why I’m so committed—not just to my own recovery, but to them, my clients, my family, and my partner.

A huge source of inspiration during this time has been **Coach Paul**, our Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu coach. I spoke with him recently about how not being able to train has been driving me crazy. Paul is like an encyclopedia of martial arts knowledge—he’s here at the gym day in and day out, even while rehabbing from a knee injury. His commitment to martial arts and resilience despite his own setbacks have really helped shift my perspective. Watching him show up, injured but still focused, reminds me of the discipline and dedication we teach.

This setback won’t stop me. It’s a challenge, but I’ve learned that life’s full of ups and downs. Sometimes you’re on top, and sometimes you get knocked down. But that’s when you roll with the punches. No matter how hard it gets, I’m not letting this derail my progress. This is my life, and I’m obsessed with getting better.

If this year has taught me anything, it’s that resilience is built in the hardest moments. When things don’t go as planned, that’s when real growth happens. I’m more determined than ever to come back stronger. The path forward might look different, but I’m still moving forward. And no matter how many curveballs life throws, I’ll keep rolling with the punches.

**Progress doesn’t stop here. It's Time To Buckle Up.**
