# The Night Before Graduation: Reflections on Growth and Friendship

Tonight is the night before I graduate, and I find myself in a reflective mood. I’m sitting here with Victor, a good friend of mine, as we work on fine-tuning his resume. It’s a quiet, unassuming moment—but one brimming with significance. This isn’t just about bullet points or formatting; it’s about growth, confidence, and the future that lies ahead for both of us.

As I guide Victor through this process, I can’t help but reminisce about my own journey at McMaster. These past years have been transformative, to say the least. I came here wide-eyed, unsure of where I would end up, but driven by a curiosity that only deepened with time. McMaster wasn’t just a place of learning; it was a space where I discovered myself.  

My love for technology has grown in ways I never could have imagined. What started as a fascination with how things worked blossomed into a passion for creating, innovating, and solving problems. But more than that, I’ve uncovered a deeper calling—a passion for teaching. There’s something profoundly rewarding about helping others, about seeing the spark in their eyes when they grasp a concept or feel confident in their abilities. Moments like this, sitting with Victor, remind me why I love sharing knowledge and encouraging growth.  

Victor has a new resume now, polished and ready to represent his best self. But more importantly, we both walk away from tonight with a newfound confidence. Application season looms large, but instead of fear, there’s excitement—a shared belief that we are prepared for what’s to come.  

As an upper-year student, I’ve had the privilege of watching Victor’s journey unfold. I remember when he first arrived at McMaster, brimming with curiosity and eager to learn. It’s been beautiful to witness his growth, to see the layers of uncertainty fall away and a more confident version of himself emerge. Watching him now, I’m reminded of how far I’ve come too.  

Graduation feels like both an ending and a beginning—a bittersweet conclusion to a chapter that’s been nothing short of life-changing. Tonight, as I sit here with a friend who has grown alongside me, I feel immense gratitude. For McMaster. For the people I’ve met. For the challenges that shaped me. And for moments like this, where the past, present, and future seem to converge in the quiet hum of a laptop and the soft exchange of words.  

Here’s to the journey so far and the road that lies ahead.
