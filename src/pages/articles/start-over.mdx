# The Beginning of My Fitness Journey: No More Excuses

Today, something finally clicked. I’ve felt this heaviness for a while now — not just physically, but mentally too. I’m not happy with how I look, how I feel, or the energy (or lack of it) that I’ve been carrying around every day. I’ve had enough of standing in front of the mirror, picking apart everything I don’t like about myself, and then doing absolutely nothing to change it.

I’ve talked about going to the gym before, you know? We all do that. “Tomorrow I’ll start,” I’d say, only for tomorrow to come and go while I find some new excuse. But today, something was different. I actually went.

And after walking out of the gym, drenched in sweat and feeling more alive than I have in months, I made a promise to myself. A real, non-negotiable promise. For the foreseeable future, I will train every single day. No more excuses. No more feeling sorry for myself. I am all in, and I am ready to embrace the pain, the sweat, and the grind.

Because at the end of the day, it all comes down to one simple, binary decision: Will I train today? Yes or no?

I will train like a madman. I will go to the gym, even on days when I don’t feel like it, even when I’m tired, sore, or just plain over it. I will go. There’s no room for a “maybe” or “later.” It’s either yes or no, and from this moment on, the answer will always be yes.

I’m starting this journey at 146 lbs, and while I know the number doesn’t define me, it’s a starting point. It’s where I am today. But more importantly, it’s not where I’m going to stay. I am determined to be better, to feel better, and to look at myself in the mirror with pride instead of frustration.

I don’t know where this road will take me, but I do know this: I will give it everything I have. Every rep, every set, every minute on the treadmill will be a step forward, no matter how small. It’s going to be hard, and I’m okay with that. The discomfort I feel today will be my strength tomorrow. The sweat I leave behind will be the evidence of my progress. The soreness will remind me that I’m growing, pushing, and evolving into the person I want to become.

This isn’t just about hitting a certain weight or achieving a certain look. It’s about proving to myself that I can commit to something, that I can follow through. That when I say I’m going to do something, I actually do it.

I’m writing this now as a reminder for the days when motivation is low, when doubt creeps in, and when I’m tempted to skip a workout. If I’m going to become the best version of myself, then it starts here, today. It starts with consistency, effort, and showing up no matter what.

This journey will not be easy, but that’s exactly why it’s worth it. I’m ready for the challenge. Every day, I’ll wake up and make that choice: yes, I will train today.

Because I’m done feeling unhappy. I’m done making excuses. From here on out, I’m chasing the best version of myself with everything I’ve got.

Let’s go.
