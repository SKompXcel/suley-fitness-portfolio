# Learning to Redefine Success

Today, I had the privilege of meeting Kanna Karanam, a Partner Group Software Engineering Manager at Microsoft. Thanks to a mentor who connected us, I got to spend time with someone who’s not only experienced but also incredibly generous with his knowledge. I feel so grateful for the insights he shared and the advice that’s had me reflecting for days.

One of the things I asked Kanna was how his definition of success has evolved over his career. Hearing his progression was both inspiring and grounding. When he first entered the industry, success was all about learning—acquiring new skills, mastering new technologies, and adding to his resume. As he advanced, it became more about solving complex problems, feeling the thrill of tackling challenges that pushed his limits. But eventually, his focus shifted again—now, his success is defined by solving those complex problems to help others, using his skills to make a positive impact.

There’s something incredibly noble in that journey—from personal growth to making a difference for others. It’s a perspective I aspire to integrate into my own path. I want to carry forward this sense of purpose, using my skills to create meaningful solutions that help people.

Kanna’s generosity didn’t end there. He offered to connect me with colleagues, and even offered a few hours each week to mentor me on behavioral interviews and share his experiences. His willingness to support my growth and give back is humbling and something I deeply admire.

It’s encounters like these that remind me of the incredible power of mentorship and community. I’m more motivated than ever to make the most of this opportunity, learn all I can, and, someday, pay it forward.
