# Gratitude and Unexpected Connections

A few weeks ago, I had the chance to meet someone who would end up having a big impact on me—Vivek. He walked into BTC, curious about martial arts, and after a conversation, he signed his whole family up for classes. In passing, he mentioned he was in tech and told me to reach out if I ever needed help making connections. Yesterday, he did just that, connecting me with someone from his network. It’s a simple gesture, but it’s one that means a lot. His mentorship and guidance came at just the right time.

In one of our conversations, Vivek shared something personal about his father, who was devoted to helping others. Back in India, his father had found work for around 80 people in their community. You could see the admiration in his eyes as he talked, and I couldn’t help but think that Vivek carries that same spirit. When I asked him how he defines success now compared to when he first started in tech, he said it used to be about money, about climbing the ladder. But now? For him, success means having his time back, being with family, and finding ways to help others. That’s the kind of perspective I really respect.

It’s funny how life works—here I am, at BTC, where martial arts has been such a central part of my life, and I cross paths with someone from the tech world, another of my passions. Sometimes, opportunities and connections come from the most unexpected places. I’m grateful for that and for people like Vivek who are willing to give back, share their experience, and show that success can be about more than just material gains.

**Here’s to rolling with the punches, building connections, and finding inspiration in every corner of life.**
