# Friendship and Gratitude: Connections That Last a Lifetime

Today, I’m reflecting on the value of friendships and connections that started back during my undergrad at McMaster. Yesterday, my friend Mahimul, now a software engineer at Amazon, referred me for a role there, and I couldn’t be more grateful. It’s a gesture that means a lot, not only for the opportunity but because of the friendship behind it.

Mahimul and I met in an innovation course, where we ended up partnering for the term project. That project became the foundation of our friendship. We spent countless hours working, laughing, and dreaming about where we’d end up. We both earned an A+ in the class, but it was the conversations, the shared goals, and the endless talks about life that became the real win. 

Mahimul’s referral feels like more than a career connection—it’s a reminder of the journey we’ve both been on. The friendships and bonds I built in school are priceless to me. These connections have shaped not only my career path but my outlook on life. I feel incredibly fortunate to have friends who believe in me and want to see me succeed.

Here’s to lifelong friends, to support that runs deep, and to opportunities that come from those who know us best. Thank you, Mahimul, for reminding me how powerful these connections are.
