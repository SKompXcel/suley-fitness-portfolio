# Six Months In: The Unstoppable Pursuit of Progress

It’s been six months since I started this journey, and the way I feel today? It’s like I’ve unlocked a new level of myself. I’m more locked in than I’ve ever been—not just physically, but mentally. I’ve found a rhythm, a groove, and the results are undeniable. I’ve taken my training to a place I didn’t think was possible when I first started. Now, every day I hit the gym, I know that there is no one working harder than me. I genuinely believe that no one is out-training me right now.

About a month ago, I leveled up in a big way. I started going to the gym twice a day—once in the morning and once at night. I’ve broken up my sessions, hitting different muscle groups with more focus and intensity. Morning sessions are for the big lifts—chest, legs, back. The night sessions are dedicated to the auxiliary muscles—triceps, shoulders, traps, forearms. This split has allowed me to increase my volume drastically. With the time to recover between these sessions and the carbs I’m fueling myself with, I can push each muscle group harder than ever before. I’m hitting my auxiliary muscles in ways I couldn’t when I was trying to cram everything into one session. The separation between chest and triceps, or back and biceps, has given me the chance to hammer them with precision and intensity.

And the changes? They’re drastic. When I look in the mirror, I see a completely different person than I did six months ago. My body is leaner, more defined, and carrying a significant amount of muscle. My weight has climbed to 157 lbs, and I’ve lost a noticeable amount of body fat along the way. I’ve fallen in love with this process—not just because of how I look, but because of how I feel. My heart rate stays steady during intense lifts, and I recover faster than I ever thought possible.

I’m eating 3,600 calories and taking in 190 grams of protein daily to fuel this machine I’ve built. My understanding of how nutrition fuels my workouts has gone through the roof. I know exactly how to time my meals to power through my morning lifts and reload for the night sessions. I feel unstoppable.

What’s driving this transformation isn’t just the physical work—it’s the knowledge I’m gaining along the way. I’ve studied the science behind lifting, the biomechanics of every movement. I understand how each muscle functions and how to target it with precision. But what’s truly made the difference is how I’ve combined that science with my own personal style, what some might call “bro science” or ego lifting. It’s a mix of textbook form and pushing my limits in ways that work for me. I know when to follow the rules, and I know when to break them to squeeze out that extra bit of intensity. This blend of knowledge and instinct has created the perfect regimen for me, and it’s why I’m seeing such rapid growth.

I’ve also changed up my split. Now, I’m working with a seven-day cycle that has me constantly engaged:

Push,
Pull,
Legs,
Shoulders, traps, core, and forearms,
Chest and back,
Arms,
Legs again
This change has given me even more control over how I attack each muscle group, and it’s helped me focus on what I’ve come to love—mind-muscle connection. I’m not just going through the motions. I’m feeling every movement. I’ve learned how to contract my muscles with intent, and that focus is paying off. Every rep, every set has a purpose. I’m locked in with every movement, dialed in on the sensation of the lift, knowing exactly what muscles are firing and why.

I’ve fallen in love with this journey. Fitness isn’t just something I do anymore—it’s who I am. I wake up every day excited to get after it, excited to push myself harder than I did the day before. The gym is my sanctuary, the place where I feel most alive, most myself. I’ve committed to this in a way I never have to anything else in my life. This is all I think about, all I care about. Fitness has become my passion, and I don’t plan on slowing down. Ever.

There’s something about this process—the grind, the discipline, the progress—that lights a fire inside me. It’s more than just the physical changes. It’s about who I’m becoming. I’m stronger, not just in body, but in mind. Every workout is a battle, not just against the weights, but against my own doubts and limits. And every day, I’m winning that battle.

The truth is, this isn’t just a phase for me. This is a lifestyle. I’ve seen firsthand what hard work can do, and I’m addicted to the results. I’m addicted to the feeling of pushing myself further than I thought possible. I don’t care if it’s a 6 a.m. chest session or a 9 p.m. triceps burnout—I’m locked in. I don’t make excuses, and I don’t take days off. I’m more committed to this than I’ve ever been to anything, and I’m just getting started.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned over these past six months, it’s that the only limits that exist are the ones you create in your own mind. When you truly commit, when you lock in and focus, there’s no ceiling to how far you can push yourself. That’s what I’m doing now—pushing beyond the limits I once thought I had and discovering that I’m capable of more than I ever imagined.

This is my passion. This is my life. And I’m not stopping anytime soon.

Let’s get after it.
