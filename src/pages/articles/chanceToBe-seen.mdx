# The Journey of Persistence: Finding Joy in the Job Search

Today feels good. It’s one of those days where, despite the uphill climb of the job search, I can pause, look back, and feel proud of the little victories along the way. The path isn’t easy, but it’s filled with moments that remind me of why I’m so passionate about this journey.

The job search continues. It’s a process of putting myself out there, striving to be seen and to demonstrate the skills I’ve worked so hard to build. Today, I sent connection requests to 30 recruiters—each one representing a glimmer of hope, a small step closer to an opportunity where I can thrive.

But this week wasn’t just about the search; it was about the connections I made and the impact I was able to have on others.

### **Rahith’s Determination Inspires Me**

I tutor a brilliant student named Rahith in data structures and algorithms. Rahith has a learning disability, but he doesn’t let it define him or hold him back. His perseverance is awe-inspiring, and every time we meet, I’m reminded of the power of determination.

I’m equally touched by the effort his mother puts into supporting him. She keeps him organized, communicates openly with me about his needs, and creates an environment where he can thrive. Witnessing Rahith’s growth as a budding computer scientist is one of the most fulfilling parts of my week. It’s a privilege to be part of his journey, and it inspires me to keep pushing forward in my own.

### **Ameen’s First Interview: A Spark Rekindled**

A few days ago, I crossed paths with Ameen, a second-year computer science student preparing for his first internship interview. His excitement was contagious—the passion in his eyes reminded me of the fire that ignited my own love for technology.

We spent time breaking down technical preparation, and I walked him through a whiteboard systems design exercise. Seeing him grasp the concepts and gain confidence was a rewarding experience. I hope I was able to instill in him not only a sense of preparedness but also the belief that he has what it takes to succeed. Moments like these reaffirm why I love technology—it’s not just about solving problems; it’s about empowering people.

### **Small Wins, Big Progress**

This morning, I started my day at the library. I completed two more LeetCode questions, bringing my total to over 450 questions, including the ones I’ve tackled on AlgoExpert. Every problem solved is another brick in the foundation of my expertise, another step toward readiness for the opportunities I’m striving to create.

### **Building Something Meaningful**

I’ve also been working on a project for E&S Solutions: a basic web app for Evergreen Renos, a renovation business in the GTA. It’s still a work in progress, but seeing the app deployed on Vercel and knowing it has the potential to help a small business thrive fills me with pride. Using my skills to create something tangible and meaningful is a reminder of why I chose this path in the first place.

### **The Bigger Picture**

Through all of this—Rahith’s growth, Ameen’s excitement, the steady progress on my projects—what stands out most is the sense of purpose I feel. Yes, the job search is tough. Yes, there are days when the rejections sting, and the uncertainty feels overwhelming. But there are also days like today, where I’m reminded that this journey isn’t just about landing a job.

It’s about learning, growing, and contributing in ways that matter. It’s about the connections I’m making and the lives I’m touching along the way.

To every recruiter who might read this: I just want the chance to share my story, to show you what I can bring to the table. My journey isn’t just about technical expertise—it’s about a deep, unwavering passion for technology, for problem-solving, and for helping others succeed.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Here’s to the journey ahead—and the hope that one of those 30 connection requests today might just lead to the opportunity I’ve been working toward.
