# Waiting to Be Seen: Reflections on Determination and Growth

Blessed for another day.  

Since graduating, I’ve been feeling more determined than ever. Walking the stage was an incredible milestone, but I’m not satisfied yet. There’s so much more I want to achieve. Every day, I’ve been tweaking my resume, polishing every word and detail, trying to make it shine.  

When I see positions open, I apply without hesitation. I’ve been pouring my energy into finding recruiters, leaving connection requests, and writing notes—probably close to two hundred over the past three days alone. As soon as I hear the ping of a new connection, I’m ready with a message, hoping it will lead to a conversation, an opportunity, or even just a moment of acknowledgment.  

To the recruiters who have accepted my requests, taken a second to read my article, or even just clicked on my profile—thank you. Your time and consideration mean more to me than you know.  

Nothing has come to fruition just yet, but I’m determined. I won’t waver. Every connection I make, every application I send, brings me closer. I feel like I’m so close—just waiting for that one opportunity to be seen.  

Software is what I love, and I will continue to work on my skills, stay consistent, and apply until my dream becomes a reality. If you’re a recruiter reading this, thank you. I’ve been working so hard, and I’d be grateful for an opportunity to demonstrate what I can do.  

Right now, I’m sitting in PGCL with my younger sister. It’s a quiet, reflective moment that reminds me of how quickly time passes. It feels like just yesterday she was a baby, and now she’s applying to universities. Part of me wants her to choose McMaster. She thinks it’s because I want her to stay close to home—and, truth be told, maybe that’s part of it. But there’s more to it than that.  

I remember being in her shoes, unsure of where to go or what to do. Back then, I couldn’t have imagined how much McMaster would shape me into the person I am today. It’s hard to put into words, but that choice was one of the best I ever made.  

Her 18th birthday is in two months, and the thought fills me with a bittersweet feeling. Watching her grow up has been one of the greatest joys of my life, but it’s hard not to wish she would slow down just a little.  

To my sister: I remember when I carried you as a baby, so small and full of wonder. Don’t grow up too quick.  

For now, I’ll keep pushing forward, one application, one connection at a time. I’ll keep learning, growing, and working toward my dream. I’m determined to make it happen.  

And I’m grateful—for today, for the journey, and for all the people who’ve been part of it.

**I won't stop here. I feel like I'm so close.**
